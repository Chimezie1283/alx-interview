# UTF-8 Validation

This project contains a Python method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
* All files must be executable

## Usage

The main file for testing is `0-main.py`, which imports the `validUTF8` function from `0-validate_utf8.py` and tests it with different data sets.

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
True
True
False
