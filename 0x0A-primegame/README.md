#  Prime Game 

For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

# Concepts Needed:
## Prime Numbers:

>> Understanding what prime numbers are.
Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.
## Sieve of Eratosthenes:

>> An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.
## Game Theory:

>> Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
## Dynamic Programming/Memoization:

>> Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
## Python Programming:

>> Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
